            <h3>Heart Disease Prediction</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="hd.png" alt="Heart Disease Prediction" style="height: 200px;">
                <ul>
                    <li>My passion for healthcare led me to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting heart disease with impressive accuracy (85.12% on training and 81.97% on test data). But I didn't stop there. I delved into the data, uncovering key factors influencing the model's predictions and exploring ways to improve generalizability across diverse demographics. I even investigated the model's "thought process" to ensure transparency and identify potential biases. By comparing my model to existing methods, I identified areas for further refinement, ensuring it remains at the forefront of heart disease prediction technology.</li>

            <h3>Mood-based Song Recommendation</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="fm.png" alt="Mood-based Song Recommendation" style="height: 200px;">
                <ul>
                    <li>Imagine a world where music seamlessly adapts to your mood. That's the reality I helped create with a real-time facial recognition web-app. Boasting an 81% accuracy rate in emotion detection, this app goes beyond just identifying emotions. It leverages them to curate personalized music recommendations, tailoring each song to your unique emotional state. But I didn't stop at the surface. I explored the potential of incorporating user preferences, cultural context, and even activity and location to create truly individualized musical journeys. Of course, privacy is paramount, and I ensured user data is collected, stored, and used responsibly, earning trust and wider adoption.</li>

            <p>
                <img src="obj.png" alt="Object Detection for Surveillance" style="height: 200px;">
                <ul>
                    <li>Surveillance systems often struggle with occlusion and lighting variations, leading to missed detections and false alarms. My deep learning object detection system addresses these challenges head-on, utilizing YOLOv4 and transfer learning to achieve superior accuracy. But innovation never sleeps. I optimized the system for real-time performance, ensuring its effectiveness in fast-paced scenarios. Additionally, I explored multi-object tracking capabilities, allowing the system to handle complex situations with multiple objects in motion. Finally, I minimized false positives and negatives, ensuring the system delivers reliable and actionable insights. By pushing the boundaries of object detection, I'm making our world safer and more secure.</li>
